        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
        const team = players;

        // console.log(players, team)
        // team[3] = 'Lux';
        // console.log(players, team);

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        // team[3] = 'Lux';

        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice()
        team2[3] = 'Lux';

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);
        
        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];

        console.log(players, team4);


        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
        const person = {
            name: 'John',
            age: 30
        }

        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 11, age: 12});
        console.log(person, cap2);
